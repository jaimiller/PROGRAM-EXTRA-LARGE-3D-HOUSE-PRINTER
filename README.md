# PROGRAM-EXTRA-LARGE-3D-HOUSE-PRINTER
Hi How are you all, full of idea's I hope,
I'm new to the field of python havnt touched coding for years,
any chance I could get a hand with this from you :).
I need to build a program for an EXTRA LARGE 3D HOUSE PRINTER.
I also any information you know of about best options for anyt parts/programs/componants/materials are welcome and apppreciated:-
           
           :-Best board to use compact wifi/Usb.
           :-Approx 12 motors (more or less pending alterations)..
                         -Appropriate XYZ AXIS sensors for calibration movement/distance and speed of print.
           :-8-12 small cameras adjustable zoom/angle/night vision etc
           
           :-Adjustible GUI (Extra's added easily Pending alterations).
           :-Best program options for 3d print program to utilise.
           :-Direct usb link mobile port on machine plus wifi/blutooth/options
                          -Backup control/Access if other options are locked out.
                          -Easy to calibrate 
           -Easily controlled from:-
                                   -Mobile Phone app/Laptop/Handheld 
                                   -Control at a distance through internet 
                                   -extra outputs for Hdmi etc
Needs to be:
           -Extra user Friendly at Gui point of control (A child could use it friendly)-Easily adjustable(Extra buttons etc added easily Pending design alterations
           -Are standard 3d printer sensors an option for movement control/distance and speed of print
           --Extra option link Drone chopper with appropriate 3d scanner
                                 :-For Initial Surveying,
                                 :-3d mapping transferable Architechural design Programs,
                                 :-Viewing progress and transfering house progress direct to Control point,
                                 :-Gyncro 3d scan info to video/audio capture,
                                 :-Depth scan propert yfor obstructions/pipes/powerlines,
                                 
Seperate project add gold/treasure scanner version for Drone chopperprogram and let it hunt for you :)
           :-mappable gps programmable path of travel,
           :-visual depth locator app for Mobile Phone/Laptop/Handheld ipad(or android)/augmented reality glasses,
           :-easy to find locator visually friendly easy to use
           :-scan readout visually in GUI Realtime/Review of various locations/heights 
           Map of Find plus mobile phone warning app
                      :-depth approx size/weight
           and distant/close range scans low to ground following terrain
