I also any information you know of about best options for anyt parts/programs/componants/materials are welcome and apppreciated:-
           
           :-Best board to use compact wifi/Usb.

           :-Appropriate XYZ AXIS sensors for calibration movement/distance and speed of print.
           :-Adjustible GUI (Extra buttons added easily Pending alterations).
           :-Best program options for 3d print program to utilise.
           :-Direct usb link mobile port on machine plus wifi/blutooth/options)
                           :-Backup control/Access if other options are locked out.

           -Are standard 3d printer sensors an option for movement control/distance and speed of print
           --Extra option link Drone chopper with appropriate 3d scanner(For Initial Surveying, 3d mapping, Architechural design Programs, Viewing progress and transfering house progress direct to Control point
