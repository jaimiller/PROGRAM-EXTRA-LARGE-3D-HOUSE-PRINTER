I'm new to the field of python havnt touched coding for years,
any chance I could get a hand with this from you :).
I need to build a program for an EXTRA LARGE 3D HOUSE PRINTER.
I also any information you know of about best options for anyt parts/programs/componants/materials are welcome and apppreciated:-
           
           :-Best board to use compact wifi control plus plugin option preferable.
           :-Approx 12 motors (more or less pending design alterations)..
           :-Appropriate sensors for distance and calibration.
           :-Adjustible GUI (Extra buttons added easily Pending design alterations).
           :-Best program options for 3d print program to utilise.
           :-Direct usb link mobile port (on machine plus extra run by wifi/blutooth any any other possible options)
                           :-Backup control/Access if other options are locked out. 
needs to be:
           -Extra user Friendly at Gui point of control (A child could use it friendly)
           -Easy to calibrate 
           -Easily controlled from Phone Laptop or handheld tablet extra outputs for Hdmi etc
